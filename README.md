# React Native: Unexpected Prop Type Warning for Function Props

This repository demonstrates a common, yet often subtle, bug in React Native applications: unexpected prop type warnings for function props.  The bug arises when a component expecting a function prop instead receives a different data type, leading to runtime crashes.

The `UnexpectedPropTypeBug.js` file showcases the problematic code. The `UnexpectedPropTypeSolution.js` file provides a corrected version, highlighting how to avoid this error.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to install dependencies.
4. Run the app using `npx react-native run-android` or `npx react-native run-ios`.
5. Observe the console logs and the behavior of the application to understand the error and its solution.

## Solution

The solution primarily involves careful prop type validation and ensuring that function props are correctly passed and used. Proper state management plays a crucial role in preventing this issue.  The `UnexpectedPropTypeSolution.js` demonstrates best practices to rectify the error.
